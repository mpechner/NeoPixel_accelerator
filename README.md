Right now just playing on a magtag.  Because it is the only board with the correct 3 pin connector for the neopixel strip I have.

Requirements:
Nopixel Library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel
Accelerometer Lib: 
    https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LIS3DH
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lis3dh-triple-axis-accelerometer-breakou

I figured out how to initilize a pattern and make it transition colors down the strip.
Red to Blue
Blue to Green
Green to Red

What I need to do is correctly write the code so the pixels will change faster or slower depending on the speed of the skate board I hope to moint this on.  

Sssshhhh making this for my neice to mount on her longboard.
